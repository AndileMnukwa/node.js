Node.js: Facilitating Contemporary Web Development
The 2009 invention of Ryan Doll, Node.js, revolutionized web development. It makes use of the V8 engine in Chrome to give JavaScript a runtime environment outside of the browser. When npm (Node Package Manager) was introduced in 2011, Node.js made it easier for people to share open-source libraries, which sped up development and cooperation.

JavaScript can be utilized for back-end development in addition to front-end development thanks to this runtime environment. Node.js has been used by Microsoft, PayPal, Netflix, and other companies because it makes building scalable event-driven systems easy. Established in 2015, the Node.js Foundation is supported by big organizations including IBM, Microsoft, and PayPal and guarantees collaborative growth and progress.

Global Nodes
A collection of global variables and objects that are available across the application are provided by Node.js. These globals provide information and functionality that are necessary for a variety of activities throughout development.

Make a Module File: Open your favorite code editor and create a new file called "my-module.js".

Getting at Module Code: In a different file, say "module-demo.js," the goal is to get at the code in "my-module.js" and make use of its features. This illustrates the power of code reuse, which is advantageous when using libraries in many files or projects.

Using the exports object in "my-module.js," you can export data to the outside world. As an illustration, make a property called "myText" and set its placeholder value to "hello from module".

Implementation Example 

// my-module.js
exports.myText = "hello from module";

// module-demo.js
const myModule = require("./my-module");
console.log(myModule.myText); // Output: hello from module

The Node Package Manager (NPM), a potent tool for managing packages—which are collections of one or more modules—is introduced by Node.js. Node.js applications can easily include more functionality and resources from these packages.

Open your console or terminal and type the following command to install Lodash:
npm install lodash

Usage: Write your code in a new file called "demo.js". Node automatically knows the default module location, so you can import Lodash by using the need function instead of giving it a path. Put it in a variable that is usually called "_". Make use of Lodash's various functions, such the "random" function, to automate tasks like creating random numbers.

// demo.js
const _ = require('lodash');
console.log(_.random(1, 100));

Execution: Save the file, then use the following command to test it:
node demo.js

Writing Files with Node.js
Overview
Now that you are proficient with file and directory operations, let's concentrate on Node.js file writing. To start file writing, we'll create a new file called "demo.js" and include the file system module.

To write a file, you must have the 'fs' module. To start, in order to access file system functions, the 'fs' module must be required.
const fs = require('fs');

Using the 'writeFile' Function: To write data to a file, use the writeFile function. Give the first parameter the file name, and the second one the data to be written.

const data = { name: 'Bob' };
fs.writeFile('data.json', JSON.stringify(data), (err) => {
    if (err) throw err;
    console.log('File written successfully!');
});

Handling JSON Object: Define a variable called "data" as a JSON object rather than giving the data directly. Give the writeFile function this data object as the second parameter.

const data = { name: 'Bob' };
fs.writeFile('data.json', JSON.stringify(data), (err) => {
    if (err) throw err;
    console.log('File written successfully!');
});

Handling Callback: The third parameter of the writeFile method is expected to be a callback. To record any problems and a "write finished" message to the console, create a callback function.

fs.writeFile('data.json', JSON.stringify(data), (err) => {
    if (err) throw err;
    console.log('File written successfully!');
});

Examining Web Frameworks for Node.js Introduction
Node.js frameworks provide the fundamental building blocks and organization needed to create web applications and APIs, acting as the cornerstones of web development.

Web frameworks are important because they provide the underlying structure for software development, much like the support structure of a house or car.

Enabling Web Development: Web frameworks are essential for building big APIs or HTTP servers because they provide the parts needed to build web APIs and serve static files.

Well-liked Express web framework for Node.js

Express is a well-established and dependable framework that is renowned for its thorough testing and simplicity.
provides an easy-to-use method for creating APIs and web apps.
Sails:

Sails has sub-frameworks such as an Object Relational Mapper (ORM) in addition to a main framework.
makes database access easier and offers more features, making it all-inclusive.
Koa:

A cutting-edge framework with cutting-edge capabilities and a modern take on web development.
It's worth investigating for developers looking for innovative solutions.


Powered by Socket.io and Express.js, Real-Time Web Applications
Overview
The first web framework made just for Node.js, Express.js, offers strong support for creating online apps and APIs. By enabling real-time, two-way, event-driven communication between the client and server, Socket.io is an excellent addition to Express.js.

Comprehending Web Applications
Web APIs and web apps are supported by Express.js. Socket.io overcomes constraints by enabling bidirectional communication, which enables the server to push notifications and data to the client in real time, while Express.js handles the back-end part of web applications.

Socket.io's Power
Bidirectional Communication: The ability to send and receive data in real time between the client and server is made possible by Socket.io.

Event-Driven Mechanism: The client-side and server-side socket.io libraries have almost the same APIs and work on an event-driven model, just like Node.js.

Real-time web apps powered by Socket.io and Express.js
Summary
Express.js, the first web framework designed specifically for Node.js, provides robust support for building online applications and APIs. Socket.io enhances Express.js by providing two-way, real-time, event-driven communication between the client and server.

Understanding Online Applications
Express.js supports web apps and web APIs. While Express.js manages the back-end of web applications, Socket.io removes limitations by enabling bidirectional communication, which allows the server to deliver notifications and data to the client in real time.

The Power of Socket.io Bidirectional Communication: Socket.io enables real-time data transmission and reception between the client and server.
